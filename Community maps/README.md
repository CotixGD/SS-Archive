# Random info
The first three maps I made was:
1. Schtiffles - Taut Strings
2. Teminite - A New Dawn
3. Creo - Idolize

First two maps were made without using BPM, third one i tried using it, but having guessed the bpm it kinda came out like shit.

Maps I suggest playing here most are:
Dimrain47 - Operation: Evolution
Dustvoxx - Trigger (Zekk Remix)
Teminite - A New Dawn

Some of these maps are listed here too: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMbPo6MUBi9JQDqwCFH__g-iSVSTFmjgQ_qC_RGXu74/edit?gid=1387001352#gid=1387001352
