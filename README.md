# SS-Archive
Almost all Sound Space maps ever made by me (Robineesti11). Old official maps, community maps and other finished maps.
I tried to group them into their own folders as well as I can remember.
Pls tell me if I made a mistake somewhere (map that isn't actually mine, wrong map data, wrong name, map broken etc.)

You can also watch videos of some of the maps on my 2nd channel (ignore the shitposts): https://www.youtube.com/@alsocotix/videos

If you wanna copy some patterns or anything from my maps youre free to do that :)

# How to play
Select the map you wanna play and click "Raw" to open the raw Github page of the file, then copy the URL and paste it into the game.
Since these maps were made before all songs got taken down, their songs have been replaced with a placeholder so that theyre still playable. You have to figure out your own way to play the map with the original song, I do it with Spotify or Youtube, where i start the song just after starting the map (and mute Roblox).
