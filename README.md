# SS-Archive
All Sound Space maps ever made by me (Robineesti11). Old official maps, community maps and other finished maps.

# How to play
Select the map you wanna play and click "Raw" to open the raw Github page of the file, then copy the URL and paste it into the game.
Since these maps were made before all songs got taken down, their songs have been replaced with a placeholder so that theyre still playable. You have to figure out your own way to play the map with the original song, I do it with Spotify or Youtube, where i start the song just after starting the map.
